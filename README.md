# ProGig

## A. Project Summary

ProGig is a service system that helps people to survive by providing a platform for finding side income. 
Nowadays, we can see that most people are giving home services such as cleaning the house, babysitting, 
sewing, cooking, and others for those who required their skills and they called as gig worker. Typically, the 
customer will seek for the skilled person or a gig worker who are able to handle the home services. Once
they found one, they will contact the person to hire them for the intended home services, and sometimes the 
flow is improper. Hence, this app will provide a suitable platform for the gig worker to find the side income 
and for the customer to hire a skilled person for required home services. The app will store all the details of 
the gig worker, such as phone number, location and skills. Customer can request intended services which 
can be handled by particular gig, meanwhile, the gig can accept or cancel the request in case not available 
on the specific request day/time. In conclusion, this app provide a dedicated platform for both parties, that is 
assist customer easily to hire gig worker for intended home services and support gig worker to get some side 
income.
